# SDL2Sim
1. SDL2 first program
2. first repository

It's my first little SDL2 project, I'm going to upgrade it in the closest future.
All this code was written really quickly, I know it's horrible.
It's gonna be divided into functions and it's gonna have multiple header files containing constants, function etc.
